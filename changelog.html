		Fixed a bug that the save is belong to NG- mode saves for some corrected saves.<br>

		Fixed a bug that exporting the save might accidentally scroll the page.<br>

		Reduced the code by some lines, code refactoring, and unnecessary/useless code removal.<br><br>

		The next build would include all of Time Dilation update and more improvements. Stay tuned!<br>

       <br>
       Made donkeys less fast, so you can actually catch them now.

          The replicanti interval is now displayed after and reductions / increases.<br>
          
          Added missing periods to various achievements.<br>

          Made the eternity autobuyer number multiply by 5 when you buy the eternity point multiplier.<br>
          
          Increased the requirement for "Is This Hell?". (5 > 6.66 seconds)<br>

          Dimensions no longer produce anything after reaching challenge goal, or after reaching infinity with fixed infinity. This is due to the c6 being abusable.<br>
          
          Made the 7 and 25 eternity milestones work much faster.<br>
          
          After unlocking bulk dimboosts, clicking dimension boost or pressing D will buy max dimension boosts.<br>

          Time dimension prices now have 2 decimal places.<br>
          
          Reformatted the tick interval reduction text for very small numbers.<br>
          
          The game now keeps track of when you automatically do an infinity, and you can passively gain IP based off the IP/min in that run if you go offline (but only if infinity isn't broken).<br>
          
          Made time study 171 apply retroactively. This was causing an issue with production being much lower than expected when going into a long run on the same run as respeccing.<br>

          Fixed a bug where the replicanti galaxy button would show as locked if you had more than the listed max replicanti galaxies and study 131.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the last ten eternities average said IP/X rather than EP/X.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the big crunch autobuyer said "X times since last crunch" instead of "X times last crunch".<br>

          Fixed a bug where you could buy factions of dimension boosts with dimension boost bulk buy.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where your autobuy max dimension boost interval would set itself to itself if you eternitied while changing it it.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where secondary statistic tabs weren't hiding upon import.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where replicanti galaxies wouldn't give a bonus if you had less than 3 galaxies.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the dimension boost autobuyer would ignore dimension boost costs until they costed 8th dimensions.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the future shop multipliers were displayed before the x rather than after.<br>
